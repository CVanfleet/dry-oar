  <h2>Clayton</h2>
  <h3>(A.K.A Vancleat)</h3>
  <p>Hello all!</p>
  <p>My name is Clayton, they called me Vancleat when I played soccer in highschool. I am living in Provo, UT with my wife and our little boy who is almost 3 weeks old! We are doing our best to adapt to our new parenting life, and we are loving it!</p>
  <p>I love to play just about any sport, my wife and I love spending time outside and watching movies. As a pass time I also enjoy a good video game.</p>
  <p>This is my first semester at BYU-I. I got my associates degree at Utah Valley University and decided I wanted a change so I transfered to BYU-I, and I have loved it so far! I am going into Information Technology to persue a software developer or programming career of some sort.</p>
  <p>I'm really excited to learn more about HTML and CSS and everything else we are learning in this class!</p>
