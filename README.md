# Welcome to WDD 100 -- Introduction to Web Design and Development

You should use this as a starting point to begin the course.


## ← index.html

Where you'll write the content of your website. You will use this through the whole course

## ← styles.css

CSS files add styling rules to your content

## ← positioning.html and positionstyle.css

These files will be used later in the semester.  You can ignore them until then (or poke around and see if you can follow what is going on there ;) Just dont's change them until you are instructed!)
